At first the pain and swelling would go away after a few minutes of using my hands in the morning, but then the swelling and pain began to last all day. I learned that these are classic symptoms of beginning rheumatoid arthritis (RA). My hand specialist confirmed that I probably have an immunological problem and we are waiting to see a rheumatologist for tests, but it will take several months to get an appointment. In the meantime, I noticed that after drinking several glasses of red wine one night, the next morning my hands were much less swollen and painful. Linking the red wine with resveratrol, I went on-line and read several testimonies where reseveratrol dramatically helped people with their symptoms of RA, so I decided to give it a try. I picked ReserveAge 250mg. I am taking one capsule twice a day and my hand pain and swelling has totally disappeared. I can wear my wedding ring again.

I know it sounds ridiculous, but it only took a week.<br \/><br \/>>> A Vitamin Shoppe Customer commented on this review on 2009-06-27<br \/>This is a Very Good Resveratrol.  Stay away from CHT Cellular Health Technologies Resveratrol...Or anything else they make.  The potency labels are inaccurate and the company CHT is impossible to contact.
